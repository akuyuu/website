A: domain part: idk i just was just browsing something online and saw .rip domain and then i thought about
        ame (nso) for some reason and it clicked and i was like  "oh wow this sounds great i really should do this" and so i did.
				 initially i though of taking akuyu.dev but then this idea popped up, so yeah, not exactly inspiring<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
design part: because i am not particularly good at coming up with
        graphics-related things so i just got inspired by nso's window layout and decided to commit to the bit. at first
        i had much more interesting idea but then i scrapped it because i dont know how to work with graphics in browsers
        so i decided to delay it and went with <i data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>this</i> </p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: you piss me off and you should grow up and change as a person!!<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: sorry... but also nope i am not really willing to change or grow up for that matter, i do sound more normal
        irl when i talk to people and they seem to like me so idk, draw conclusions yourself
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: wow i think ur cool what do you even do in your life?<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: yeah no i am not cool by any means and my life is not even interesting, just a regular life.
        its not that boring though, sometimes i get incredible human to human interactions which leave me perplexed
        (maybe i should get a separate page to share them, idk)
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: what do you like?<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: sleeping. but i dont get enough of sleep.... i also really really like talking about my interests
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: what do you not like then?<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: pretentious people and fake people. like really dont like them. i also dont like overly serious people. like imagine
        always being serious - that is no fun, especially when you try to approach people like that, theres literally no angle to do that from<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
i also dont like heat and hot weather, absolutely disgusting, winter and lukewarm places for the win
        (although summer evening are incredible and probably only good thing about warm/hot seasons)
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: you mentioned interests, what are you interested in?<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: i used to play a lot of games (mostly indie), so naturally i like games. it would be logical to list games
        i like here but eeh, dont wanna (although you can probably see one that i really like already :^))<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
i also really really like music i listen to and im not limited to one genre (although theres definitely a dominating one)
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: do you "fw" [some specific thing]?<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: quick and inaccurate answer: if this thing is extremely popular then theres a good chance that no,
        otherwise almost always yes.
        in any case you can just ask me directly if you want to know for sure
</p> <p data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
Q: where are you from? how old are you? ...and other not so interesting questions<br data-astro-cid-nhi6zqwg>
A: knowing answers would change nothing so not telling... ill let this be a small guessing game for now though,
        tbh it shouldnt be that hard to guess (hint: i am far from being old and im located somewhere in eu)
