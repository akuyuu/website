    <h2>questions which you <i>might</i> want hear answers to</h2>
    <p>Q: why the hell does your website has this domain and pages look like this??<br>
        A: domain part: idk i was just browsing something online and saw .rip domain and then i suddenly thought about
        ame (nso) for some reason (maybe because i was replaying nso at that time, idk) and it clicked and i was like
        "oh wow this sounds great i really should do this" and so i did. initially i thought of taking akuyu.dev but
        then this idea popped up ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (and .dev is pretty generic imo)<br><br>
        design part: because i am not particularly good at coming up with
        graphics-related things so i just got inspired by nso's window layout and decided to commit to the bit. at first
        i had much more interesting idea but then i scrapped it because i dont know how to work with graphics in browsers
        so i decided to delay it and went with <i>this</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: you piss me off and you should grow up and change as a person!!<br>
				A: sorry... but also nope i am not really willing to change or grow up for that matter,
        i do sound more normal irl when i talk to people and they seem to like me so idk, draw conclusions yourself.
        for the most part i am like this because irl i look way too serious so i compensate that with my online presence
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: wow i think ur cool what do you even do in your life?<br>
        A: yeah no i am not cool by any means and my life is not even interesting, just a regular life.
        its not that as boring though, sometimes i get incredible human to human interactions which leave me perplexed
        (maybe i should get a separate page to share them, idk)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: what do you like?<br>
        A: sleeping. but i dont get enough of sleep.... i also really really like talking about my interests
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: what do you not like then?<br>
        A: fake people, in a sense that you can <i>feel</i> that something in their actions is not quite right.
        i also dont like overly serious people. like imagine always being serious, that is no fun, especially when you
        try to approach people like that, theres literally no angle to do that from<br>
        i also dont like heat and hot weather, absolutely disgusting, winter and spring-like places for the win
        (although summer evening are incredible and probably only good thing about hot weather)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: you mentioned interests, what are you interested in?<br>
        A: i used to play a lot of games (mostly indie), so naturally, i like games (and you probably can already see
        one that i really like already :^))<br>
        i also really really like music i listen to and im not limited to one genre (although theres definitely a dominating one)<br>
        and i also have a small physical music collection of albums that i like (vinyls)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: do you "fw" [some specific thing]?<br>
        A: idk just ask me, but answer's probably going to be that im fine with it because i dont mind most things that exist out there
    </p>
