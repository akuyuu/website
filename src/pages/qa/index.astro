    <h1>questions which you <i>might</i> want hear answers to</h1>
    <p>Q: why the hell does your website has this domain and pages look like this??<br>
        A: domain part: idk i just was just browsing something online and saw .rip domain and then i thought about
        ame(nso) for some reason and it clicked and i was like  "oh wow this sounds great i should really do this"
        so yeah, not very inspiring.<br>
        design part: because i am not really good at coming up with
        graphics-related things so i just got inspired by nso's window layout and decided to commit to the bit. at first
        i had much more interesting idea but then i scrapped it because i dont know how to actually work with graphics in browsers
        so i put it in long-term plans and went with <i>this</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: wow i think ur cool what do you even do in your life?<br>
        A: yeah no i am not cool by any means and my life is not that interesting, just a regular life.
        its not that boring though, sometimes i get incredible human to human interactions which leave me perplexed
        (maybe i should get a separate page to share them, idk)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: where are you from? how old are you? ...and other not so interesting questions<br>
        A: nope sorry not telling :^))) ill let this be a small guessing game for now, tbh it shouldnt be that hard
        (hint: i am far from being old and im located somewhere in eu)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: what do you like?<br>
        A: sleeping. but i dont get enough of sleep.... i also really really like talking about my interests
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: what do you not like then?<br>
        A: pretentious people. like really dont like them. i also dont like overly serious people. like imagine
        always being serious, that is no fun, especially when you try to approach people like that, theres literally no angle to do that from<br>
        i also dont like heat and hot weather in general, absolutely disgusting, winter for the win
        (although summer evening are incredible and probably only good thing about warm/hot seasons)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: you mentioned interests, what are you interested in?<br>
        A: i used to play a lot of games, so naturally i like games. it would be logical to list games i like here but eeh, dont wanna
        (although you can probably already see one that i really like :^))<br>
        i also really like music i listen to and im not exactly limited to one genre
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: you piss me off and you should grow up and change as a person!!<br>
        A: sorry... but also nope i am not really willing to change, i do sound more normal irl to attempt to appeal to people tho
        (and it seems to work so yeah, draw conclusions yourself)
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: okay but are you actually normal or not then?<br>
        A: idk i usually dont think about this because why bother? its like thinking about myself and falling into pit of despair
        after discovering something about myself, which is why i prefer not doing that
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: do you "fw" [some specific thing]?<br>
        A: quick and inaccurate answer is: if thing is extremely popular then theres a good chance that no, otherwise almost always yes.
        in any case you can just ask me directly if you want to know for sure
    </p>
